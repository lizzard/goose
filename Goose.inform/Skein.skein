Office Goose
An Interactive Fiction by Lizzard
Release 9 / Serial number 191006 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD
It's a beautiful day in the office, and you are a horrible goose.
(If you aren't sure how to play, type "help" and hit enter.)

Open-plan office
You're in a large open room. Narrow corridors run between grey-walled cubicles. Exits lead east, west, and south.

You can see a potted palm and a printer here.
